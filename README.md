**THE_GUTS**
i made this page pretty quickly with the knowledge that i have now vrs when i first started doing stuff. definitely stuff i had wish i had known previously LOL.
===
inside this is a simple stack of 3 html files linked together via buttons. 
the images in my profile i actually created myself and i thought the made pretty cool backgrounds. i used the nav bar generator from Materialize because well. i like its functionality better than i did with normal bootstrap. and ofcourse vanilla CSS because i like it and i like the way it looks and you really can't change my mind about it lol atleast not until i am better at it.
